## Termux / Android constraints

- Claude Code runs inside the Ubuntu proot: `/tmp` exists and is writable
  (tmpfs), cleared on each new proot session -- nothing may be left there
  between sessions.
- Native Termux: `/tmp` exists but is NOT writable (owned by `shell`, mode
  `drwxrwx--x`). The writable temp dir is `$TMPDIR`
  (`/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp`). Verified 2026-08-13.
- Bash through Claude Code works. If a script fails, diagnose the actual
  constraint before modifying the script or blaming the environment.
- Commands intended for Roberto to run must be single-line and copy-paste
  ready.
